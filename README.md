### STAGE 1:
INITIAL ORBITAL SATELLITE ANALYSIS
#### Launch analysis
As the first step, we use a simple launch vehicle like an [Atlas V series](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/114763167/193393064-eae55759-5540-45be-b88f-8d4490ad902c.png) to send the spacecraft from Earth or Planet A to Planet by with [solid fuel boosters](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/114763167/193393139-38cd3715-debd-436b-941a-d1f6f7bca0fa.png) as per requirement to launch the spacecraft into orbit of Planet B. By the use of basic [RD 180 engines](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/114763167/193393215-718901c3-8e0c-4400-9899-be249948d42c.png) or similar constructs and solid rocket boosters which are discarded after the Earth's atmosphere is left, after which, a [payload adapter](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/114763167/193393252-26b8674e-b374-401d-9e4b-90da932b0eef.png) system releases the orbiter from the launch vehicle.

The [payload fairings](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/114763167/193393274-cf549188-0196-47f1-b1bc-3f62c6a19a96.png) used to protect the spacecraft from weather in earth before launch and aero heating in the atmosphere which might lead to damage in the components of the orbiter, is jettisoned when the launch vehicle reaches the required height where none of these factors play a role anymore

#### Orbiter analysis

The orbiter might be of any kind, as per the requirements of the planet, designed to carry instruments into the atmosphere and orbit to capture the various characteristics of the planet which would render it an exploration worth or not, hance giving an idea about the various conditions of the planet.

Some of these instruments might be:
* HIRISE-high resolution image sensing expert, to study landscape evolution and changes of the planet
* CTX-context camera, it provides high resolution photos to the other cameras of the rover for analysis
* Weather sensing systems-to help study the weather and seasonal changes in the surface and atmosphere of the planet
* SHARAD- shallow radar, it is used to loo for water in the first few kilometers of the planet's crust using radar technology

most of the above given instruments of the orbiter are from previous orbiter missions used to explore other planets(mars)

The power for the said orbiter would be derived from the star nearby as solar poweras any planet not in the vicinity of a star is to be assumed inhabitable without any second thoughts.

by the results given by the orbiter, an AI sensing systems checks if an exploratory mission is feasible, if the planet is worth an exploratory mission to look for habitable environment or minerals worth a fortune, and if it checks out, we move on to STAGE 2


### STAGE 2:
LAND BASED RESEARCH DOCK ANALYSIS:
#### Launch analysis
As the second step, we use spacecraft systems which are powerful beyond scope of commercial spacecraft launches like the [ARTEMIS-I](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/114763167/193393399-8884658c-cd54-4c5d-b43b-bda4df2b5972.png)
which has not been launched yet, [RS 25 engines](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/114763167/193393342-f438823e-9483-408b-85d1-32a0f3861b9a.png) used to thrust the heavy, wet system off the Earth's/ planet A's gravitational field, fueled by a highly compressed liquied hydrogen tank, along with solid rocket boosters which help in propulsion, after the atmosphere crossed, the engine fuel systems and the booster systems detach, leaving the liquid oxygen propulsion system to take over, on the fuel being emptied, the payload adapters and the other jettsioning parts are removed, leaving the interim cryogenic propulsion system, which ensure a smooth landing on the destination planet.

#### Research dock analysis

The research dock is the cargo carried by the incredibly powerful rocket systems, it contains:
* Instruments required for indetail accurate analysis
* [MMRTGG](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/114763167/193394157-0bb01a53-20cd-44e4-94ae-a420603e6c7e.png), which multi mission plutonium based radio isotope thermo electric generator, aka power source incase of harsh weather
* Bots, which are used to collect various samples of various kinds from various terrains.
* X-Band communcations system for contact with home base(hopefully still earth)

Instruments required in the research dock:
* MEDA like systems, makes weather measurements from dust particles to humidity and windspeed.
* Rocks and minerals analyser(not only pictorial, but also chemical).
* SHERLOC-Scanning Habitable Environments with Raman & Luminescence for Organics & Chemicals
* Bio tissue analyser
* Capsuling technology(for when they are retrived if needed by another spacecraft mission for further analysis in earth)
* Bot repair and charging systems

#### Bots analysis
There would be different kind of bots to navigate and obtain various kinds of samples from all types of terrains
They are:
* Droids: Droids are stay at dock robots which help to conduct the analysis of the samples collected, and repair any damage that might have happened to the other robots or the dock itself. They are to be considered utility robots built to finish any task given to them, capable of running an AI system which easens to work when connected to the other robots in an Intranet of Things.
* Aerial drones: Aerial drones are supposed to be rescue and carrier robots which are supposed to carry the samples which are provided to it by the rovers and the hybrids. They are also equipped to bring back or recover rovers and hybrids from compromising conditions like being stuck in a mudpit. They are used for this purpose because they can traverse farther distance than any other kind of robots in a given span of time, the only two conditions to be kept in mind are weather(could be flown over) and air density, very low air density of a planet can result in a situation where flight is impossible(these are to be checked by the orbiter in stage 1 to make the expedition more cost efficient). They are also used to collect aerial samples.
* Rovers: Rovers are robots that crawl through the different terraneous surfaces of the planet equipped with tools just to break down parts of a huge material to help collect samples, which are then sent to the dock with the help of the drones. They are solar powered for most situations, but for an emergency, the drones can get them out of difficult situations or supply power.
* Hybrids: Now Hybrids are basically the combination of any two of the given robots which can perform almost all the tasks resulting in a more efficient, but inneffective use, since they cannot perform as good as both the bots combined.

### STAGE 3:
#### CONTROL TESTING:

In step 3, an AI compares the samples collected with the samples from earth as control along with the samples collected from the planet to check is the planet is suitable for human habitation, and as a result the test shows us habitability percentage. another AI records the data from the new collected samples and creates a database for future reference, which helps as the database for the planet habitablility guide.

types of data stored in the database:
* high resolution photos, for image recognition
* microscopic imaging, for tissue based samples
* chemical composition, for identifying a particular element or compound in the wild
* weather data, to made predictions about weather forecasts to help navigate the planet in ease
* surface data, to draw a rough map of the surface and terrain of the planet

#### CONSOLE CREATION:

The console is the module which consists of the tools required for onsite analysis for searching recorded results from the database, which has been loaded onto the main server to let all connected devices access the information
